A Twitch Bot with YouTube Functionality

Uses NAudio and YouTube Explode to play Videos from YouTube as well as moderate (unimplemented as of yet) Chat. Displays chat using embedded Chrome.

Please feel free to implement and add bits, and make PR's! I'm active and will be dogfooding this bot myself (https://twitch.tv/PFCKrutonium)
